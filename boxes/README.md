# Boxes inventory

This is a simple program bases on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T3ZDquDDVg) video.

When you start, it will display:

```
Boxes simulator 1.0
    p: print a box
    e: edit the contents of a box
    q: quit
```

when you select an option, it asks for the box number, and you can see if the box is empty:

```
p
Box ID: 2
Box 2: <empty>


Boxes simulator 1.0
    p: print a box
    e: edit the contents of a box
    q: quit
```

And the cycle continues
